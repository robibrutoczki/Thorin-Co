<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his
    travels in The Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves
    also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a
    fourteenth to fill in to their party.</p>

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the Mountain or the Mountain King, was the son of Thráin
            II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin
            was best known for his deeds
            as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and
            for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of the Five Armies.</p>

        <p class="lead">Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and
            possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest
            of Thorin's companions, who were most often
            named only in "group" references to the entire company.</p>

        <h3>Gandalf</h3>
        <p>Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of
            Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time
            amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In his "youth", he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë,
            Varda, Irmo and Nienna named. He was associated with light and fire, much like his peer Varda.[3] Yet his
            ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but he walked
            unseen among them, or wore a fana that appeared like an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that
            made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, he took pity on the sorrows of
            the Children of Ilúvatar and drove those who listened to him out of despair.</p>

        <p class="lead">Frodo Baggins, son of Drogo Baggins, was a Hobbit of the Shire during the Third Age. He was, and
            still is, Tolkien's most renowned character for his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he bore
            the One Ring to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best friend to his gardener,
            Samwise Gamgee, and one of the three Hobbits who sailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end
            of the Third Age.</p>

        <p>Aragorn II, son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as Elessar and Strider, was the 16th Chieftain of the

            King of Arnor and 35th King of Gondor - and first High King of Gondor and Arnor since the short reign of
            Isildur. He was a great ranger and warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil, reforged and
            renamed Andúril, Flame of the West, in the War of the Ring.</p>

        <h3 class="featurette-heading">Oin</h3>
        <p class="lead">Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually
            wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin
            Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
            wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim
            the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company.
            He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with
            many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.</p>
